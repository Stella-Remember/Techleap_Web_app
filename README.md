## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or above)  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- **npm** (Node Package Manager)  
  npm comes with Node.js, so installing Node.js will install npm automatically.

- **Git** (for cloning the repository)  
  [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- **Database** (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL depending on the project setup)  
  Make sure your database is running locally or remotely.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash```
git clone https://github.com/Stella-Remember/Tech_Leap-_v1.0.git

## Navigate into the project directory:

```bash```
-Copy code
-cd TechLeap
-Install Dependencies
-Once inside the project directory, install all the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash``
Copy code
npm install
This will download all the required libraries and packages listed in the package.json file.

## Set up the Database
## 1. Set up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project (if it doesn't already exist). Inside the .env file, add the necessary environment variables for your database, API keys, and other configurations. Example:

```bash```
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=27017
DB_NAME=tech_leap
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
## 2. Database Configuration
Make sure you have a database running (for example, MongoDB). You can use a locally installed database or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.

If using MongoDB:

Install MongoDB from MongoDB Official Website.
Start the MongoDB service on your local machine.
Alternatively, you can use a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Ensure your .env file contains the correct details for connecting to your database.

## Configuration
Ensure the configuration files are properly set up:

Frontend Configuration: If the project uses a frontend (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.), make sure the frontend configuration is properly linked to the backend via API URLs in the environment file.

Other Configurations: You may also need to configure things like the server port, authentication, or third-party services in the .env or config.js files.

## Running the Application
Once all dependencies are installed and configurations are set, you can start the application with the following command:

```bash```
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server on the default port (usually 3000 or defined in the .env file). You can access the app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Running the Frontend (If Applicable)
If your project has a separate frontend, navigate to the frontend folder (if applicable) and run:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
This will run the frontend locally on a different port (e.g., 3001).

Testing
To run the tests, simply execute the following command:

```bash```
Copy code
npm test
This will run the unit and integration tests for the project. Ensure you have your database and services running before executing tests that depend on external APIs or services.

## Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

Missing .env file: If the application crashes due to missing environment variables, make sure you've created the .env file as described in the configuration step.

Database Connection Errors: Verify that your database is running and the correct connection details are set in the .env file.

Port Conflicts: If the application fails to start due to a port conflict, check if another application is using the default port. You can change the port by updating the PORT variable in your .env file.

Module Installation Errors: If you face issues with missing modules, try deleting the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file, then run npm install again:

```bash```
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
Additional Information
API Documentation: If the project exposes an API, you should include API documentation here. You can use tools like Swagger to generate API documentation.

Contributions: If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!

### Key Features:
1. **Copy Button**: The use of triple backticks (` ```bash```) creates the code blocks with a copy button when viewed on GitHub.
2. **Clickable Links**: The Table of Contents uses Markdown anchor links to navigate sections easily.
3. **Organized Sections**: Each section has clear headings, ensuring readability.
